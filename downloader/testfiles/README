There are a bunch of files missing from here, they were mostly nasty sites that
have malformed HTML and stuff that were causing libxml to choke. Now I've moved
over to BeautifulSoup they aren't so useful, plus they're not mine to give away
anyway. 

I'm keeping this dir around as it may come in useful later on.
