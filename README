0. Intro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the years I've talked a lot of crap about when the best time to create
a new subforum is, warning about the dangers of killing a small and fragile 
community by splitting it too early.

Dead forums don't attract new users, people want support or to be part of a 
discussion and if people aren't seen to be about then new users will bounce
without creating a new account. I usually complain to new site-ops that too 
many subforums at the beginning presents the risk of early fragmentation, a
problem that can kill a new community before it even gets started. I'm also
known to moan about the addition of subforums as it is much easier to add a
new one than it is to merge or retire an old one.

These beliefs come from seeing communities fade away or fail to start, they 
may even be called wisdom, but without being backed up by evidence they are
conjecture rather than knowledge. Also, what if I'm wrong? I can't barge in
on your community and announce that you're doing it wrong if I don't have a 
shred of evidence that I'm right in the first place. Well, not righteously! 

So stand back, I'm about to do science!

This project contains a bunch of tools to gather stats from different types
of web forums; the frequency of posts, subforum creation dates, the numbers
of users joining and leaving and so on. Once I've got enough data then I'll 
analyze it and publish my conclusions. Hopefully, they'll support the noise 
I've been spouting for years. If not, then at least I can take satisfaction 
in being a big know-it-all. I'll also gain some experience in doing science
and learn a bit more about statistics along the way.

Hopefully.

1. Workflow
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WIP:

1) Gather data:
 * start with a list of known good forum URLs
 * any thread can do any work.
 * work from back to front, so new posts are done last?

a) Use the appropriate parser to find the forum's index page.
b) Save the list of subforums.
c) Save the list of threads in each subforum.
d) Visit individual threads, save post times and authors.

2) Create statistics

3) Draw pretty graphs
